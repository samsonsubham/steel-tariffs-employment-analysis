# Steel Tariffs and Manufacturing Employment: An Econometric Analysis
## Research Question
How do steel tariffs affect employment and wages in steel-using industries relative to control industries?

## Key Findings
- **Steel-using industries employ 186% more workers** than textile control industries (p < 0.001)
- **Steel-using industries have 327% higher wages** than textile control industries (p < 0.001)  
- **The employment advantage decreased by 24%** during Biden era relative to Trump era (p < 0.05)
- **Effects are statistically significant** despite explaining only 4.3% of total variance

## Economic Interpretation
Steel tariffs create clear sectoral advantages for steel-using industries, but these advantages 
have diminished over time, possibly due to accumulating downstream cost pressures.

## Technical Notes
- Sample: 8,547 establishment-quarter observations (2020-2024)
- Method: Difference-in-differences with robust standard errors
- Industries: Iron & Steel, Motor Vehicles (treatment) vs Textiles (control)
- Data: Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages

## Policy Relevance
Results inform ongoing debates about trade protection effects on downstream manufacturing.
